# Coding_Challenge
This is my final project of this semester, using PHP and Symfony 4, entitled Pharmacy "PharmaVie".
This part of project is about implementing a web app that lists products of each pharmacy :
As a User, I can sign up using my email & password
As a User, I can sign in using my email & password
As a User, I can update my profil
As a User, I can manage my products (add, update or delete) from the stock
As a User, I can update my state of the day (Normal time / Permanence time) to inform patients (in the mobile part of the project).
